# playwright-ts
This repo is my first idea to start building a web automation framework with playwright

##  Install Playwright 
`npm init playright@latest `

##  Runs the end-to-end tests.
`npx playwright test`

##  Starts the interactive UI mode.
`  npx playwright test --ui`

##  Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.
 ` npx playwright test --project=chromium`

##  Runs the tests in a specific file.
  `npx playwright test example`

##  Runs the tests in debug mode.
`  npx playwright test --debug`

##  Auto generate tests with Codegen.
`  npx playwright codegen`


`  npm playwright test --reporter=dot`
